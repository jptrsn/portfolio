A while ago, I decided to challenge myself to completely refactor my domain's website. For too long, I had let it languish while I played with other,
more interesting ideas, so I wanted to try something.

I learn best when I'm working on a problem that I can understand. Building an entire portfolio from scratch felt daunting every time I imagined it,
but _refactoring my existing site?_ For some reason, that felt like something with less inertia to overcome, and I could start on it immediately.

Here it is: a React NextJS Typescript static website with Tailwind4, hosted in GitHub pages, and built and deployed using a CI/CD pipeline.

Because it's more fun for me to learn something when I've got a good place to get started, and once I get going, I like to keep going.

I hope you enjoy it.
