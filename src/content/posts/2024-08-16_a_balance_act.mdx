description: Building a successful app means you need to be on the cutting-edge of what's being done in the space, while simultaneously serving as broad a base of users across as wide a spectrum of hardware as possible. Ultimately, both are critical to the value users will feel they get from the app, and a successful startup needs to make thoughtful decisions to accomplish their goals.

## Confession Time

### When it comes to tech, _I like a very particular category of shiny new things._

I don't covet the latest in mobile phone hardware. I don't immediately feel the need to own the newest form-factor hardware, the thinnest laptop, or the flashiest ear buds.

### What I'm really interested in is _tech that's changing the way we solve problems._

Those things are often not tangible things, but instead they could be a new approach to solving a bottleneck, a new way to reach existing hardware, or new capabilities that let us solve problems in new ways.

For example, the [BitTorrent Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) changed the way we considered the problem of distribution of information on the internet. Before then, we solved distribution in a way that worked in other media and industries, where the provider had to scale up with demand. A new way of thinking about digital distribution permits scalining up automatically _with_ demand, by turning consumers into distributors as well.

And each new generation of Bluetooth comes with new features and capabilities. A relatively recent development called [Auracast](https://www.bluetooth.com/auracast/how-it-works/) is enabling developers to deliver experiences aurally as well as visually, in many cases using hardware the user already owns.

## Where's the Problem?
