Okay, I'm trying something new. Well, not new, but I'm going to try to get in the habit of regularly publishing _something_ online.

(oh, if you want to catch up, you can read about me [here](/about "About"))

"Why?" I hear my brain ask, and the answer is simple: I've got _ideas_.

Simple ideas, maybe, but ideas nonetheless.

I've built a career from learning from others, most of whom published and shared their knowledge openly and freely.

So this is my commitment: I'm going to attempt to regularly write posts that reflect what's on my mind, personally and professionally, in a free and open manner.

Cheers!
